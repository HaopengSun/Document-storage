## About Document storage

- Nested set ([lazychaser/laravel-nestedset](https://github.com/lazychaser/laravel-nestedset)) is used to build relation between folders and files. If the users enable document feature, root node will be created in the File Model. All folders and files that this user created will be saved using nested set.
- [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) is used for Form/Modal.
